> With learning how to use Github and Github flow, I'm creating a Javascript program that outputs a random joke every time it is run in Node.js.

## General info
The program will stitch together a nonsensical "joke" by stitching together strings (words) from various arrays that correspond to different areas of English grammar (verb array, noun array, adjective array, etc). It creates an opening and a punchline. Usually it ain't funny.

## Technologies
* VS Code - Version 1.52.0
* git version 2.29.2.windows.2
* Node.js

## Setup
Running the script in Node.js will output a random joke to the console.

## Code Examples
randomJokeSetup(qArr,subjectArr,vArr1,vArr2,nArr,tArr,adjArr,placeArr); 
//this is the function that executes the program. Each parameter is a different array that includes strings that correspond to a different category of English grammar.

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* Makes a nonsensical joke
* Might make you laugh
* It's completely free

To-do list:
* N/A

Ideas for future improvement:
* Limit the selection of certain words in the punchline based on how the setup question is structured.

## Status
Project is: __Complete... for now?__

## Inspiration
This project is based on Codecademy's assignment "Mixed Messages" for the Full Stack Developer course.
